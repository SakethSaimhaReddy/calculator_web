The calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations, as well as percentage calculation. The display area shows the entered numbers and the result of the calculations.

## To-Do List Web Application

## Stopwatch

The Stopwatch project is a simple stopwatch implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a user interface with a timer display and buttons to start/stop the stopwatch and reset it.


## Quote Generator

The Quote Generator project displays random quotes to inspire and motivate users. Each time the user clicks the "More Quote" button, a new quote will be generated and displayed. The quotes are randomly selected from a predefined array and attributed to their respective authors.
